  				<h1>Policies</h1>
  				<h3><i>Financing:</i> <br> <br> 1. Equity Financing <br>

Angel Investors: We seek investments from angel investors who are passionate about sustainability and eco-friendly products. In exchange for their investment, they receive ownership equity or convertible debt. <br>
Venture Capital: We partner with venture capital firms that specialize in eco-friendly ventures, ensuring that we not only receive substantial funding but also valuable strategic guidance. <br> <br>
2. Debt Financing <br>

Bank Loans: We obtain traditional bank loans with competitive interest rates, leveraging company assets as collateral to secure the necessary capital for growth. <br>
Microloans: We utilize microloan programs tailored for small businesses, offered by nonprofit organizations or government agencies, to support our financing needs. <br> <br> 
3. Crowdfunding <br>

Reward-Based Crowdfunding: We engage with platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to pre-sell our eco-friendly water bottles and raise funds from early supporters in exchange for exclusive products and rewards.
Equity Crowdfunding: We offer small equity stakes in our company through equity crowdfunding platforms, allowing a broader audience to invest in our mission and products. <br> <br>
4. Government Grants and Subsidies <br> 

Environmental Grants: We apply for grants and subsidies from government agencies and environmental organizations dedicated to supporting sustainable and eco-friendly initiatives. <br> <br>
 
5. Trade Credit <br>

Supplier Financing: We negotiate favorable payment terms with our suppliers, enabling us to defer payments for raw materials or inventory purchases, which helps in managing cash flow. <br> <br>

6. Leasing <br>

Equipment Leasing: We lease manufacturing equipment rather than purchasing it outright, which conserves cash flow while ensuring we have the necessary production capabilities. <br> <br>

7. Retained Earnings <br>

Reinvestment: We reinvest our profits back into the company, funding growth initiatives and minimizing the need for external financing while focusing on sustainable expansion. <br> <br>

8. Invoice Financing <br>

Factoring: We sell our accounts receivable to factoring companies at a discount to quickly obtain cash, improving liquidity and operational flexibility. <br> <br>

9. Green Bonds <br>

Issuing Green Bonds: We raise capital by issuing green bonds specifically designed to fund environmentally friendly projects, appealing to socially responsible investors.<br> <br>

10. Strategic Partnerships <br>

Joint Ventures: We form strategic partnerships or joint ventures with like-minded companies to share resources and co-finance projects, aligning with our commitment to sustainability.
<br> <br> <i>Delivery:</i> <br> <br> 1. Standard Shipping <br>

Reliable and Affordable: Our standard shipping option ensures that your order arrives within 5-7 business days. We use reliable carriers to deliver your eco-friendly water bottles safely and affordably. <br> <br>
2. Expedited Shipping <br>

Global Reach: We offer international shipping to bring our eco-friendly water bottles to customers worldwide. Delivery times and rates vary by destination, and we provide tracking information for all international orders. <br><br>
4. Eco-Friendly Packaging <br>

Sustainable and Minimal: We are committed to sustainability in every aspect of our business. Our water bottles are shipped in eco-friendly packaging made from recycled materials, reducing waste and our environmental footprint. <br><br>
5. Order Tracking <br>

Stay Informed: Once your order is shipped, you'll receive a tracking number via email. Use this number to track your package in real-time and stay updated on its delivery status from our warehouse to your doorstep. <br><br> <i>Return Policies:</i> <br><br> 1. 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee <br>

Hassle-Free Returns: We stand by the quality of our eco-friendly water bottles. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can return the product within 30 days of receiving it for a full refund or exchange. Simply contact our customer service team to initiate the return process, and we’ll provide you with a prepaid return label. <br><br>
